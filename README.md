2)Mvc Project-This is a full web app designed for a small buisness to manage their employees,clients,billing etc.It is built on Asp.Net Mvc standard.  

3)Yatzhee Refactoring Project-This is a c# command line game of Yatzhee in which I got a badly designed program and refactored it to try and comply with the core software design principles of encapsulation,delegation,and contract with attention given to Bob martin's SOLID principles where they apply.I alse added a implementation to play the game(The original project just had the scoring methods without the ability to play the game) 

4)Html Project-This is a  product review web page (which allows users to star a item or write a review) which uses Html for structure, css for style and Jquery for interactivity.
