# Course-Final-Projects
My final projects of each of the courses in my .Net full stack development course.

1)Datbase Project- a c# console program that uses Entity Framework to connect to a sql server database.This particular database is devoted to building security. 

2)Mvc Project- a full web app designed for a small buisness to manage their employees,clients,billing etc.It is built on Asp.Net Mvc standard.  

3)Yatzhee Refactoring Project- a c# command line game of Yatzhee in which I got a badly designed program and refactored it.The game had to had to be refactored to comply with the core software design principles of encapsulation,delegation,and contract with attention given to Bob martin's SOLID principles where they apply.I alse added a implementation to play the game(The original project just had the scoring methods without a program to play the game) 

4)Html Project-This is a  product review web page  which uses Html for structure, css for style and Jquery for interactivity.
I just added a 2nd version in which html is loaded dynamically from Jquery as opposed to the 1st version in which the html is hard coded.
